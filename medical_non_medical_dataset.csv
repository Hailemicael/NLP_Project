viral bacterial viral infection cause kind symptom difficult distinguish cause specific infection distinguishing two important since viral infection cured antibiotic whereas bacterial infection pathophysiology general chain event applies infection sometimes called chain infection transmission chain chain event involves several step include infectious agent reservoir entering susceptible host exit transmission new host link must present chronological order infection develop understanding step help health care worker target infection prevent occurring first place colonization infection begin organism successfully enters body grows multiplies referred colonization human easily infected compromised weakened immune system increased susceptibility chronic persistent infection individual suppressed immune system particularly susceptible opportunistic infection entrance host hostpathogen interface generally occurs mucosa orifice like oral cavity nose eye genitalia anus microbe enter

identifying infectious agent either directly indirectly practice minor infectious disease wart cutaneous abscess respiratory system infection diarrheal disease diagnosed clinical presentation treated without knowledge specific causative agent conclusion cause disease based upon likelihood patient came contact particular agent presence microbe community epidemiological consideration given sufficient effort known infectious agent specifically identified benefit identification however often greatly outweighed cost often specific treatment cause obvious outcome infection benign diagnosis infectious disease nearly always initiated medical history physical examination detailed identification technique involve culture infectious agent isolated patient culture allows identification infectious organism examining microscopic feature detecting presence substance produced pathogen directly identifying organism genotype technique xrays cat scan pet scan nmr used produce image internal abnormality resulting growth infectious agent image useful detection example bone abscess spongiform encephalopathy produced prion symptomatic diagnostics diagnosis aided presenting symptom individual infectious disease yet usually need additional diagnostic technique confirm suspicion sign specifically characteristic indicative disease called pathognomonic sign rare infection symptomaticin child presence cyanosis rapid breathing poor peripheral perfusion petechial rash increase risk serious infection greater fold important indicator include parental concern clinical instinct temperature greater c microbial culture many diagnostic approach depend microbiological culture isolate pathogen appropriate clinical specimen microbial culture growth medium provided specific agent sample taken potentially diseased tissue fluid tested presence infectious agent able grow within medium many pathogenic bacteria easily grown nutrient agar form solid medium supply carbohydrate protein necessary growth along copious amount water single bacterium grow visible mound surface plate called colony may separated colony melded together lawn size color shape form colony characteristic bacterial specie specific genetic makeup strain environment support growth ingredient often added plate aid identification plate may contain substance permit growth bacteria others change color response certain bacteria others bacteriological plate commonly used clinical identification infectious bacterium microbial culture may also used identification virus medium case cell grown culture virus infect alter kill case viral identification region dead cell result viral growth called plaque eukaryotic parasite may also grown culture mean identifying particular agentin absence suitable plate culture technique microbe require culture within live animal bacteria mycobacterium leprae treponema pallidum grown animal although serological microscopic technique make use live animal unnecessary virus also usually identified using alternative growth culture animal virus may grown embryonated egg another useful identification method xenodiagnosis use vector support growth infectious agent chaga disease significant example difficult directly demonstrate presence causative agent trypanosoma cruzi patient therefore make difficult definitively make diagnosis case xenodiagnosis involves use vector chaga agent cruzi uninfected triatomine bug take blood meal person suspected infected bug later inspected growth cruzi within gut microscopy another principal tool diagnosis infectious disease microscopy virtually culture technique discussed rely point microscopic examination definitive identification infectious agent microscopy may carried simple instrument compound light microscope instrument complex electron microscope sample obtained patient may viewed directly light microscope often rapidly lead identification microscopy often also used conjunction biochemical staining technique made exquisitely specific used combination antibody based technique example use antibody made artificially fluorescent fluorescently labeled antibody directed bind identify specific antigen present pathogen fluorescence microscope used detect fluorescently labeled antibody bound internalized antigen within clinical sample cultured cell technique especially useful diagnosis viral disease light microscope incapable identifying virus directlyother microscopic procedure may also aid identifying infectious agent almost cell readily stain number basic dye due electrostatic attraction negatively charged cellular molecule positive charge dye cell normally transparent microscope using stain increase contrast cell background staining cell dye giemsa stain crystal violet allows microscopist describe size shape internal external component association cell response bacteria different staining procedure used taxonomic classification microbe well two method gram stain acidfast stain standard approach used classify bacteria diagnosis disease gram stain identifies bacterial group bacillota actinomycetota contain many significant human pathogen acidfast staining procedure identifies actinomycetota genus mycobacterium nocardia biochemical test biochemical test used identification infectious agent include detection metabolic enzymatic product characteristic particular infectious agent since bacteria ferment carbohydrate pattern characteristic genus specie detection fermentation product commonly used bacterial identification acid alcohol gas usually detected test bacteria grown selective liquid solid mediathe isolation enzyme infected tissue also provide basis biochemical diagnosis infectious disease example human make neither rna

biochemical test viral infection although strictly speaking hemagglutinin enzyme metabolic functionserological method highly sensitive specific often extremely rapid test used identify microorganism test based upon ability antibody bind specifically antigen antigen usually protein carbohydrate made infectious agent bound antibody binding set chain event visibly obvious various way dependent upon test example strep throat often diagnosed within minute based appearance antigen made causative agent pyogenes retrieved patient throat cotton swab serological test available usually preferred route identification however test costly develop reagent used test often require refrigeration serological method extremely costly although commonly used strep test inexpensivecomplex serological technique

allowing quantitation target antigen aid diagnosis infectious disease immunoassay detect measure antigen either infectious agent protein generated infected organism response foreign agent example immunoassay may detect presence surface protein virus particle immunoassay b hand may detect measure antibody produced organism immune system made neutralize allow destruction virus instrumentation used read extremely small signal created secondary reaction linked antibody antigen binding instrumentation control sampling reagent use reaction time signal detection calculation result data management yield costeffective automated process diagnosis infectious disease pcrbased diagnostics technology based upon polymerase chain reaction pcr method become nearly ubiquitous gold standard diagnostics near future several reason first catalog infectious agent grown point virtually significant infectious agent human population identified second infectious agent must grow within human body cause disease essentially must amplify nucleic acid order cause disease amplification nucleic acid infected tissue offer opportunity detect infectious agent using pcr third essential tool directing pcr primer derived genome infectious agent time genome known alreadythus technological ability detect infectious agent rapidly specifically currently available remaining blockade use pcr standard tool diagnosis cost application neither insurmountable diagnosis disease benefit development pcr method clostridial disease tetanus botulism disease fundamentally biological poisoning relatively small number infectious bacteria produce extremely potent neurotoxin significant proliferation infectious agent occur limit ability pcr detect presence bacteria metagenomic sequencing given wide range bacterial viral fungal protozoal helminthic pathogen cause debilitating lifethreatening illness ability quickly identify cause infection important yet often challenging example half case encephalitis severe illness affecting brain remain undiagnosed despite extensive testing using standard care microbiological culture stateoftheart clinical laboratory method metagenomic sequencingbased diagnostic test currently developed clinical use show promise sensitive specific rapid way diagnose infection using single allencompassing test test similar current pcr test however untargeted whole genome
